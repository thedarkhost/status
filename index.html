We are now monitoring the uptime of our gateways in
case they have a problem we can resolve it quicker.

We restarted some gateways to apply kernel upgrades.

All the bad parts have been replaced. Almost
everything is back to normal and orders are back
to processing.

A system we built had parts fail, we are re-building
the system and new customers will face delays until
