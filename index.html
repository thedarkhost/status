Here we keep everyone on top of things that are
happening for day-to-day operations at DARKHOST
and this page serves as a place to check status
if the servers go down.

Restarted some gateways to install updates.

2016-02-15
Continuing to process orders and help setup new
eCommerce stores.

2016-02-14
Servers have been stable. We also got some new
big servers so we will be getting rid of some of
our unstable servers.

2016-02-13
I felt it was a good idea to post an update on what
is happening. We expanded staff and increased our
sales, but our servers and staff couldn't meet the
workload.

To compensate for this we have raised our prices while
we continue to improve. If you placed an order and didn't
get a response quickly, we are sorry, but we will make it
up to you.

2016-02-12
Things are back to normal

2016-02-11
Some gateways were restarted and we are rebuilding
some servers. Thank you for your patience.

We had a RAID device fail on a server that hosted
about 30+ customers. Your data is safe but it took
time to rebuild the disk array and recover any VMs
from having shutdown abruptly.

2016-02-08
Admin is back and working! Sorry support staff!

2016-02-07
2016-02-06

2016-02-05
2016-02-04
We restarted a few gateways. VMs were saved in between.

2016-02-03
Some servers were stuck today we have resolved the
issue and continue to improve uptime.

2016-02-02
2016-02-01
We are now monitoring the uptime of our gateways in
case they have a problem we can resolve it quicker.

2016-01-30
We restarted some gateways to apply kernel upgrades.

2016-01-29
All the bad parts have been replaced. Almost
everything is back to normal and orders are back
to processing.

2016-01-28
Insert montage here.

New machine is built and new customers are being
processed again. Newegg sent us multiple broken
parts.

2016-01-25
2016-01-24
A system we built had parts fail, we are re-building
the system and new customers will face delays until
this is resolved.

we do hardware upgrades etc.
